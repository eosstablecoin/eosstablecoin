    "eosstabledes":"EOS stable coins are the mappings of major blockchain assets on EOS.IO network. Users who hold major blockchain assets are able to swap their assets from original blockchain network to EOS.IO network through gateway service so as to utilize them in DAPPs or decentralized exchanges. EOS stable coins enrich the diversity of EOS ecosystem and offer a convenient way for users from other blockchain network to experience the EOS world.",
    "expense":"Fee",
    "expensedes":"To cover the operating costs of the gateway, while avoiding malicious in-and-out transfer, a certain amount of handling fee will be charged upon the gateway swap service. This fee will be charged unidirectionally whilst redeeming the cross-chain assets back to the original assets. The standard is 0.5‰ of the swapped assets. Meanwhile, the miner/gas fees occurred upon transactions on some blockchain networks will be deducted from the user’s total received amount as the case may be.",
    "expenseinfo":"(To encourage people to experience the EOS stable coins, before March 31, 2019, users who swap their assets to stable coins on EOS through the cross-chain gateway will be exempted from charging fees when they redeem those assets back to the original network at any time.)",
    "support":"Supported blockchain assets: BTC ETH USDT",
    "infotips":"At this initial period, all cross-chain stable coins are pegged to the existing coins in the gateway cold wallets. As the circulation increases, cold wallets will be upgraded to multi-sig cold wallets along with several hot wallets, and the real-time balance will be calculated and displayed then.",
