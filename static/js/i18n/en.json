    "eosstabledes":"EOS stable coins are the mappings of major blockchain assets on EOS.IO network. Users who hold major blockchain assets are able to swap their assets from original blockchain network to EOS.IO network through gateway service so as to utilize them in DAPPs or decentralized exchanges. EOS stable coins enrich the diversity of EOS ecosystem and offer a convenient way for users from other blockchain network to experience the EOS world.",
    "expense":"Fee",
    "expensedes":"To cover the operating costs of the gateway, while avoiding malicious in-and-out transfer, a certain amount of handling fee will be charged upon the gateway swap service. This fee will be charged unidirectionally whilst redeeming the cross-chain assets back to the original assets. The standard is 0.05% of the swapped assets. Meanwhile, the miner/gas fees occurred upon transactions on some blockchain networks will be deducted from the userâ€™s total received amount as the case may be.",
    "expenseinfo":"(To encourage people to experience the EOS stable coins, before March 31, 2019, users who swap their assets to stable coins on EOS through the cross-chain gateway will be exempted from charging fees when they redeem those assets back to the original network at any time.)",
    "support":"Supported blockchain assets: BTC ETH USDT",
    "infotips":"All stable coins in circulation are less than or equal to the balance in reserve addresses. Each issuance on the EOS network has a deposit to reserve address in original blockchain and can be checked on the blockchain. As the circulation increases, reserve wallets will be upgraded to multi-sig cold wallets.",
